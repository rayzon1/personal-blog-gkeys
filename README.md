## Personal React blog - covering and docmenting topics I've learned as a beginning Web developer.

1. **Layout**: The layout of the page is simple, mainly a SPA with a menu bar only having relevant topics and information. 
  - Layout using FlexBox CSS layout for all pages and sections.
  - Used FlexBox instead of Grid to maintain the simple block style of the site.
2. **Style**: Styles and animations using CSS as well as react-transition-group.
